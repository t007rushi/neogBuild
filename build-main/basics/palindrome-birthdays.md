# palindrome birthday

- Take your user's birthday
- Tell whether user was born on a palindrome day or not. 
- Use one of these formats to put dates eg: MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YY, etc. Having atleast one date-format out of these is mandatory, adding extra date formats is a bonus.
     
## bonus

- If the user's birthday is not a palindrome, then tell them what is the nearest date from their birthdate which is a palindrome date. 
     - Tell them by how many days they missed it.
- show a gif when you're doing the calculation to show that numbers are being crunched.
- problem with this is that it will not slow your computer, explore setTimeout in JS to produce an artificial delay.
